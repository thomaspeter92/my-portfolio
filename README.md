# my-portfolio
Front End development portfolio site for Thomas Buckley


<h2> About this project </h2>
<p>This is a simple portfolio wbsite designed and built for myself. I wanted to create a clean and well postioned page, making use of whitespace and my chosen color theme. </p>
<h3>Built With</h3>
<p>This project is built using SASS, which is then compiled with npm into a main style.css file. I made use of BEM (block, element, modifier) CSS conventions 
to keep the code modular and dry. For postioning of elements I used the float grid system. This is not the most modern approach to take, and is shunned in favor of
flexbox or the CSS grid system. However, being comfortable with both of these praactices I wanted to challenge myself with something different and take a shot at using
floats.
